# Shore to Core to Shore Tax Increment Financing District

This project aims to walk a user through how the introduction of a TIF in Cleveland aims to change the landscape of downtown Cleveland. The TIF aims to fund public infrastructure projects along the lakefront, in the core of downtown, and along the riverfront. The project currently does not have any interactive mapping components on City of Cleveland websites, and I believe that it could use an interactive mapping experience to better connect with Cleveland residents to enhance understanding of the project. 

This project uses Mapbox.gljs and includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript files (along with GEOJSON files from the City of Cleveland) to build an interactive experience for the user. The final version of this map will be one where the user will scroll through the map (often referred to as scrollytelling) and be taken on a journey to better understand what TIFs are and how they work, current conditions and rendered images along the lakeshore, in the core, and along the riverfront, and concluding thoughts about other potential areas the city should think about providing investment to.
