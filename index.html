            <h3>What is Shore-to-Core-to-Shore?</h3>
            <p>Shore-to-Core-to-Shore is an initiative in the City of Cleveland, Ohio to redevelop and transform
                downtown
                Cleveland. The plan aims to generate between 3.5 and 7.5 billion dollars worth of revenue through a Tax
                Increment Financing
                District to revitalize the lakefront, the downtown core, and the riverfront.</p>

        <h3>What is the Shore-to-Core-to-Shore Tax Increment Financing District?</h3>
        <p>The Shore-to-Core-to-Shore Tax Increment Financing district, or TIF, is a designated zone where a portion of
            new property tax revenue generated by an increase in property values are redirected to a separate fund.
            The dollars in the fund are then used for public investments, and in this case, the City of Cleveland can
            spend funds throughout the city, but will focuse on substantial investments along the lakefront and
            riverfront in the downtown core. </p>
